## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Utilized pandas and NLTK to clean and preprocess the Kaggle dataset, ensuring the data is in an optimal format for analysis.

- **Tag Vectorization:** Combined multiple columns to create meaningful tags and converted them into vectors using sklearn.

- **Similarity Search:** Implemented similarity search algorithms to predict and recommend movies based on user-defined tags.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- sklearn
- nltk

Install additional dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
